		detailedDescription: `Townhall is a comprehensive community platform designed to facilitate volunteer collaboration and community engagement. As the lead developer, I was responsible for architecting the entire system from the ground up.

The platform features a robust user management system with secure authentication, real-time communication through WebSockets, and a sophisticated media handling system. I implemented a layered backend architecture using Django that ensures scalability and maintainability.

Key features include user onboarding and profile management, real-time post and comment system, media upload and management, WebSocket-based notifications, and responsive design for all devices.`,

		detailedDescription: `Speedie is a comprehensive car care companion app that demystifies vehicle warning lights and provides actionable advice for drivers. The app features an interactive dashboard that explains vehicle warning lights with urgency levels, repair advice, and educational videos.

I designed and developed the entire application with a focus on user experience and accessibility. The app includes a playful radial menu that lays the foundation for future tools like a service scheduler, AI mechanic assistant, and mileage tracker.

The biggest challenge was taking complex automotive information and making it digestible for everyday drivers. I used progressive disclosure to present information in digestible chunks, implemented a modular component system with TypeScript for type safety, and conducted accessibility testing to ensure the app works for everyone.`,
