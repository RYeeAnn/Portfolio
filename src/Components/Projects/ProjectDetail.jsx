		description: 'A Chrome extension that automates job application form filling with smart field detection and one-click templates.',
		detailedDescription: `As someone actively job searching, I was spending hours rewriting the same responses to common questions like "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?" and "What is your greatest strength/weakness?" I built this project to solve a personal problem of spending too much time answering repetitive questions in job applications.

The Chrome extension automatically detects form fields on job application pages and provides one-click templates for common questions. It intelligently recognizes different field types and suggests relevant pre-written responses that I can customize on the fly. No more copying and pasting from a separate document or retyping the same answers over and over.

Building this taught me a lot about the Chrome Extensions API, content script injection, and DOM manipulation. The biggest challenge was making the field detection work across different job sites with varying HTML structures. I had to create flexible selectors that could adapt to different form layouts while still being reliable enough to fill the right fields with the right content.`,

The platform features a robust user management system with secure authentication, real-time communication through WebSockets, and a sophisticated media handling system. I implemented a layered backend architecture using Django that ensures scalability and maintainability.

Key features include user onboarding and profile management, real-time post and comment system, media upload and management, WebSocket-based notifications, and responsive design for all devices.`,

I designed and developed the entire application with a focus on user experience and accessibility. The app includes a playful radial menu that lays the foundation for future tools like a service scheduler, AI mechanic assistant, and mileage tracker.

The biggest challenge was taking complex automotive information and making it digestible for everyday drivers. I used progressive disclosure to present information in digestible chunks, implemented a modular component system with TypeScript for type safety, and conducted accessibility testing to ensure the app works for everyone.`,

Previously, she managed all bookings manually in a notebook, requiring clients to call and have conversations to schedule appointments.

I built this website to modernize her business and create a professional online presence. Instead of just giving out a phone number, she can now share this application with potential clients, allowing them to learn about her services and book appointments online. It provides a polished, professional baseline for referrals while maintaining the intimate, private nature of her salon.

The website features an online booking system, service showcase, contact information, and a gallery of her work. This project was particularly meaningful as it directly solved a real-world problem for my family business and helped my mother streamline her client management process.`,
