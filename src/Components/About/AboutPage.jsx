                            Hey there! I'm Ryan, a software developer based in Vancouver, BC. My path into tech wasn't exactly the typical route. I studied Electrical Engineering at UBC and worked in the automotive industry before jumping into software. That switch happened after I did a 12-week bootcamp at BrainStation, and that's what got me started on this path.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Since then I've built stuff like a community platform for volunteers, tools that help drivers understand their cars better, and some fun learning games. What I really love is creating things that people actually find useful and enjoy using.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            In my spare time, you'll find me checking out new coffee shops around the city, working on my car, playing games or playing volleyball.
                        </p>
