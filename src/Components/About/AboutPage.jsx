                            <p>
                                Hey there! I'm Ryan, a software developer based in Vancouver, BC. My path into tech wasn't exactly the typical route. I studied Electrical Engineering at UBC and worked in the automotive industry before jumping into software. That switch happened after I did a 12-week bootcamp at BrainStation, and that's what got me started on this path.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <h2 className="about-page__story-heading">What I Build</h2>
                            <p>
                                Since then I've built stuff like a community platform for volunteers, tools that help drivers understand their cars better, and some fun learning games. What I really love is creating things that people actually find useful and enjoy using.

                            <p>
                                In my spare time, you'll find me checking out new coffee shops around the city, working on my car, playing games, playing badminton, or playing volleyball.
